# About

I'd identify myself as:

`Futurist` • `Scientist` • `Software Engineer (Java SE/EE)` • `Inventor`

I'm working as a software engineer from 2017 on personal projects and from 2020 in production. At the moment, I managed to work with various small and large companies, gaining the necessary valuable experience. 

Since I attended art school as a child and drew a lot, I also have a creative approach to programming.

### Contribution to the community 

Since 2017, in my free time, I've been asking and answering technical questions from others. My goal is not to chase numbers, but to help others and learn new technologies.
